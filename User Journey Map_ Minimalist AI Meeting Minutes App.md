## User Journey Map: Minimalist AI Meeting Minutes App

This user journey map outlines the user's experience through the app, strictly adhering to the revised pricing structure (Version 4).

### Phase 1: Initial Access and Trial Experience (Unauthenticated User)

1.  **Direct App Access:** The user navigates to the app's URL and is immediately presented with the main application interface. There is no landing page or mandatory sign-up, allowing for instant engagement.

2.  **Core Functionality Exploration:** The user can immediately begin using the app's core features:
    *   **Input:** They can paste text or upload text-based files (.txt, .docx) to be summarized.
    *   **AI Generation:** They can trigger the AI to generate a structured summary of their input.
    *   **Editing:** They can edit the generated summary directly in the app.

3.  **Initial Limitations and Alerts:**
    *   **No Audio Transcription:** If the user attempts to upload an audio file or use a voice input feature, a prompt will appear, stating that this is a Pro feature and requires a subscription.
    *   **No Auto-Save:** A subtle, non-intrusive notification will be periodically visible, kindly informing the user that their work is not being saved and that they need to sign up and subscribe to enable auto-save.
    *   **Gated Features:** The "Save," "Share," and "Export" buttons are visible but disabled or marked with a "Pro" icon. Any attempt to click them will trigger a prompt to subscribe.

4.  **Session-Based Usage Limit:** The user can generate a limited number of AI summaries (e.g., 3-5). As they approach this limit, a reminder will appear, informing them of the remaining free generations. Once the limit is reached, a blocking prompt will appear, requiring them to subscribe to continue using the AI features.





### Phase 2: User Interactions with Gated Features and Conversion Prompts

1.  **Attempting Gated Features (Save, Share, Export):**
    *   **Action:** The user, having generated and possibly edited a summary, attempts to click on the "Save," "Share," or "Export" button.
    *   **System Response:** A clear, persistent, and polite modal or in-app notification appears. This prompt explains that the attempted action (saving, sharing, or exporting) is a Pro feature and requires a subscription. It will offer a direct call-to-action to subscribe to the Pro Tier.
    *   **User Choice:** The user can either subscribe or dismiss the prompt and continue using the app within the trial limitations.

2.  **Attempting Audio Transcription:**
    *   **Action:** The user attempts to use the audio transcription input method.
    *   **System Response:** A clear, persistent modal or in-app notification appears, stating that audio transcription is a Pro feature and requires a subscription. It will offer a direct call-to-action to subscribe to the Pro Tier.
    *   **User Choice:** The user can either subscribe or choose to use text/file input instead.

3.  **Encountering Auto-Save Alerts:**
    *   **Action:** As the user continues to work on a summary without saving, periodic, subtle, and kind alerts will appear (e.g., a small banner at the top of the screen, a subtle icon). These alerts will remind the user that their work is not being automatically saved and that auto-save is a Pro feature.
    *   **System Response:** The alert will include a gentle prompt to sign up (if not already signed up) and subscribe to enable auto-save and secure their work.
    *   **User Choice:** The user can ignore the alert, sign up, or subscribe.

4.  **Reaching Compulsory Session-Based Usage Limit:**
    *   **Action:** The user reaches the predefined limit of AI generations within their current session (e.g., after 3-5 summaries).
    *   **System Response:** A prominent, blocking modal appears. This modal clearly states that the user has reached their usage limit for AI generations and cannot proceed with further AI processing without subscribing. It will offer a direct and prominent call-to-action to subscribe to the Pro Tier.
    *   **User Choice:** The user must subscribe to continue using the AI generation features. Reminders before this hard cut-off will have already prepared them for this.

5.  **Sign-Up Without Subscription:**
    *   **Action:** A user, prompted by a gated feature or a usage limit, decides to sign up for an account but does not immediately subscribe to the Pro Tier.
    *   **System Response:** The user successfully creates an account. However, the app clearly indicates that they are still on the trial experience. All limitations (no audio transcription, no saving/sharing/exporting, no auto-save, compulsory session limits) remain active. The UI will subtly reflect their trial status (e.g., a banner, a specific icon next to their profile).
    *   **User Experience:** The user can now access their account dashboard (if applicable) but will continue to encounter prompts for subscription when attempting gated features or hitting usage limits.

6.  **Post Sign-Up Onboarding Flow:**
    *   **Action:** Immediately after successful sign-up (whether prompted by a gated feature or initiated by the user), the user is redirected to a quick onboarding flow.
    *   **System Response:** A series of concise screens or steps guides the user to provide essential profile information (e.g., name, preferred language for minutes, time zone) and set up basic account preferences. This flow should be mandatory but brief, focusing only on critical data for app functionality and personalization.
    *   **User Experience:** The user completes the onboarding, which then leads them back to the main app interface, still within the trial experience, but with their profile updated.





### Phase 3: Pro Tier Subscription and Full Access

1.  **Subscription Process:**
    *   **Action:** The user clicks on a 


subscription prompt (from a gated feature, usage limit, or direct navigation to pricing).
    *   **System Response:** The app guides the user through a simple subscription process (e.g., payment gateway integration).
    *   **Confirmation:** Upon successful subscription, the user receives confirmation, and their account status is immediately updated to Pro.

2.  **Full Feature Unlocking:**
    *   **Action:** The user returns to the app after subscribing.
    *   **System Response:** All previously gated features are now fully accessible:
        *   **Audio Transcription:** The audio input option is enabled.
        *   **Saving:** The "Save" functionality is active, and auto-save is enabled for all new and existing work.
        *   **Sharing & Exporting:** The "Share" and "Export" options are fully functional.
        *   **AI Generation Limits:** The user now has access to higher AI generation limits (e.g., 100 meetings/month) with standard processing speeds.
    *   **User Experience:** The UI reflects the Pro status (e.g., removal of "Pro" badges, clear indication of subscription).

3.  **Ongoing Usage as a Pro User:**
    *   **Action:** The user continues to use the app for their meeting minute needs.
    *   **System Response:** The app operates seamlessly, providing all promised features and capacities.
    *   **Monitoring Usage:** The app internally tracks the user's monthly meeting usage. If they approach their 100-meeting limit, a subtle notification might appear, suggesting they are nearing their capacity, but without blocking access unless an overage policy is implemented later.

4.  **Subscription Management:**
    *   **Action:** The user may need to manage their subscription (e.g., view billing, cancel).
    *   **System Response:** A dedicated section within the user's account settings allows for easy subscription management.






### Summary of User Journey and Conversion Points:

This user journey is designed to provide immediate, albeit limited, value to new users, allowing them to experience the core AI summarization capabilities. The strategic gating of essential features (saving, sharing, exporting, audio transcription, auto-save) and the implementation of compulsory session-based usage limits create clear and compelling reasons for users to convert to the Pro Tier. The various prompts are designed to be timely and direct, guiding the user towards subscription at points of high motivation. The single Pro Tier simplifies the decision-making process for the user, offering a clear path to unlock full functionality and a seamless experience.
